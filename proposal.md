# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

3D Protein Visualization

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that visualizes the structure of proteins using 3D graphics

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will allow the user to visualize proteins by showing the 3D protein structure. The user will be able to rotate the protein, zoom in and out, and even select different parts of the protein, including different subunits and amino acid residues. For the visualization, I will use some sort of gaming software tool to devlop the visuals. Additionally, to make the program user friendly, I will have to involve a graphical user interface. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

    -Set up the visual interface using some sort of gaming software

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

    -Visualize the protein structure accurately, including correct folding and amino acid sequence

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

    -implement intuitive graphical user interface

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

    -learn about different options for visualization techniques
    -learn about graphical user interface
    -learn about how to use these in conjunction with data such as protein sequences
    -learn how to get things to appear where they are supposed to
